# Database Cleanup: Fix Corrupted paper_id Values

**Date**: 2025-07-19
**Issue**: Database had corrupted paper_id values with both URL format and ID format, creating duplicates.

## Problem Analysis
- **Total papers**: 228,624 rows
- **URL format**: 228,003 papers with `http://arxiv.org/abs/...` format
- **ID format**: 621 papers with clean ID format (e.g., `2507.13351v1`)
- **Duplicates**: 620 papers existed in both formats
- **Root cause**: Inconsistent paper_id handling in ingestion process

## Solution
Simplified approach: Delete all records with URL format in paper_id field, keeping only clean ID format records.

```sql
DELETE FROM papers WHERE paper_id LIKE 'http%' OR paper_id LIKE 'https%'
```

## Results
- **Before**: 228,624 total papers (many duplicates)
- **After**: 621 unique papers 
- **Removed**: 228,003 duplicate/corrupted records
- **Status**: âœ… All paper_id values now in clean format, no duplicates

## Data Integrity
- All remaining papers have proper titles and content
- Concise summaries preserved for papers that had them
- Database size significantly reduced but with clean, consistent data
- arxiv_url field still contains full URLs for reference

## Follow-up Actions
- The recent ingest fix (INSERT OR IGNORE) will prevent future duplicates
- Future ingests will work with clean, consistent paper_id format
- Database performance should be improved with smaller, cleaner dataset

## Files Modified
- Database: `./data/arxiv_papers.db` (cleaned via SQL)
- No code changes needed (cleanup was one-time operation)

This cleanup resolves the paper_id corruption issue and provides a clean foundation for future development.
