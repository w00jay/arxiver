# Vector Database Reconstruction Required

## Issue Summary
ChromaDB was experiencing '_type' errors and schema compatibility issues that prevented the fill-missing-embeddings endpoint from functioning properly.

## Root Cause
- Data corruption in existing ChromaDB collection
- Schema mismatch between stored data format and ChromaDB v1.0.15 expectations
- Error: `mismatched types; Rust type 'u64' (as SQL type 'INTEGER') is not compatible with SQL type 'BLOB'`

## Solution Applied
**Complete vector database reconstruction was required**

### Steps Taken:
1. **Backup corrupted data** - Original ChromaDB moved to `data/arxiv_embeddings.chroma.corrupted_backup`
2. **Created fresh ChromaDB** with clean configuration
3. **Updated main.py** to ensure consistent metadata configuration: `{"hnsw:space": "cosine"}`
4. **Tested with small batch** - Verified 10 papers work correctly
5. **Migrated to production** - Replaced corrupted DB with working version

### Files Modified:
- `arxiver/main.py` - Fixed collection creation metadata in fill-missing-embeddings endpoint
- Added migration scripts: `fix_chromadb_type_error.py`, `migrate_chromadb.py`, `create_fresh_chromadb.py`

## Current Status
✅ ChromaDB collection "arxiver" operational with 10 test documents  
✅ Query functionality verified working  
✅ Ready for full embedding regeneration  

## Next Steps
1. Run `fill-missing-embeddings` to rebuild full embedding database (228K+ papers)
2. All vector search and recommendation features should work normally
3. No data loss in paper database - only embeddings needed regeneration

## Important Note
**This was a one-time reconstruction due to data corruption. Future ChromaDB operations should work normally without requiring database rebuilds.**
